## Introduction

1.1 Reinforcement Learning (RL)

  * RL is learning what to do - how to map situations to actions - so as to maximize a **numerical reward signal**.
  * Two characteristics: (1) trial-and-error search; (2) delayed reward.
  * RL is trying to maximize a reward signal instead of trying to find hidden structure.
  * RL explicitly considers whole problem of a goal-directed agent interacting with an uncertain environment.
  * RL starts wtih a complete, interactive, goal-seeking agent.
